Complete the Guess the Square Root game. The game logic works as follows. Select a random number between 1 and 100. Then ask the user what the square root of the number is. If they get it correct, add 1 to their score. If they get it wrong, tell them the right answer. Repeat the game three times then report their total score. 

```
Welcome to the Guess the Square Root Game!

What's the square root of 41? 6.2

## File 3

Create a "max number" utility. Using method overloading, create 4 methods named 'max' with two parameters. One takes two integers, one takes two doubles, and the remaining two take one integer and one double. Each method should return the maximum of the parameters. Then write a main program to test your methods. 

```
4, 6.3

6.3 is larger.
