## File 1

Complete a Paragraph Analyzer program.  Given a paragraph, count the number of words, find the longest word, find the shortest word, and count the number of "the"s in the paragraph. 

```
Input: Programming is both an art and a science. It requires creativity to design solutions and precision to implement them correctly. Many beginners start with small projects, such as calculators or simple games, before moving on to larger challenges. Along the way, they learn about algorithms, debugging, and the importance of writing clean, readable code.

Number of words: 54
Longest word: programming
Shortest word: a
Occurrences of "the": 2
```

Complete the Guess the Square Root game. The game logic works as follows. Select a random number between 1 and 100. Then ask the user what the square root of the number is. If they get it correct, add 1 to their score. If they get it wrong, tell them the right answer. Repeat the game three times then report their total score. 

```
Welcome to the Guess the Square Root Game!

What's the square root of 41? 6.2
So close, it's 6.403

What's the square root of 64? 8.0
Nice job!

What's the square root of 22? 5.0
So close, it's 4.6904

You got 1/3.
```


## File 3

Create a "max number" utility. Using method overloading, create 4 methods named 'max' with two parameters. One takes two integers, one takes two doubles, and the remaining two take one integer and one double. Each method should return the maximum of the parameters. Then write a main program to test your methods. 

```
4, 6.3

6.3 is larger.
